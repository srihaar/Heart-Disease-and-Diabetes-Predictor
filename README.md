## used python pandas for data wrangling and data manipulation
## used python matplotlib module for graphical visualizations
## used python sklearn model for machine learning models
## used keras which is higher level api of theano and tensorflow frameworks which are used to build the models using neural nets
## used k fold cross validation for better accuracy
## built the model by examining several machine learning models and taking the best out of it
## used python flask for backend
